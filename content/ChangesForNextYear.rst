General
=======


get rid of awk class and add a python class (or cover more grep)

add all data that we used this year.


Problem Set 3
=============

was quite hard. We could make it simpler by providing stubs


class 10
========

Dont included the extra lines in `sample-seq-info.csv` it was too confusing
to use the skip_while arg to toolshed.reader to pass a function

More interactive. 

Replace this class with a more applied one on debugging, functions, simple
nested data structures and program flow.

class 13
========

better example for Map
