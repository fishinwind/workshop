#. Melt the `expr-geno-covs.txt` data table.

#. Load the `expr-geno-covs.txt <../misc/data/expr-geno-covs.txt>` data.
   Use ``ddply`` to calculate the mean age of smokers grouped by gender
   and smoking status. Plot the result.

#. Load a BED file (e.g. ``lamina.bed``) and calculate the mean length of
   regions on each chromosome in the BED file with plyr.  Plot the result as
