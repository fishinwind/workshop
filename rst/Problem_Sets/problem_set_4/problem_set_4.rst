Overview
--------
For this quiz you will write programs in Python to analyze data. 

.. note::

    Continue to use the organization scheme that we learned about in
    :ref:`problem-set-1`. Part of our evaluation
    will include whether you are developing good organizational habits.

Create a ``run.sh`` file that executes the commands for each problem and
writes out each result in a dated directory.

Problems 
--------
Use Python to create data structures built from records in a BED file.

Download the bed file here: :ref:`bed-file`

    #. Load a BED file and create a dict() of lists() of (start, end)
       tuples. Find the largest and smallest starts for each chromosome
       (**10 points**)

Problem Set Submission
----------------------
Submit your problem set as a tar file to Canvas
(:ref:`problem-set-submission`).
