Programming Tips & Tricks
=========================

Overview
--------
Several things influence how effectively you can learn to program, and how
well you program once you have basic ideas down. Most of these have to do
with your efficiency in actaully *using* a computer, and not programming
*per se*.

For example, the longer you spend searching for a particular key to type,
or surfing around with your mouse, the less time you spend writing,
running and debugging programs. Here are several pointers to help you
become more efficient at using computers, independent of actually learning
programming languages.

Learn to type
-------------
Once you have typing basics down, you should be typing 40-50 words per
minute without any problem. I learned to type on a typewriter (seriously).
Hunting and pecking is inefficient, and prevents you from spending your
valuable time efficiently. Moreover, if you're looking at your keyboard,
you're *not* looking at the screen, reading and debugging code.

There are several good, modern tools to help you type faster.

Learn to type funny characters
------------------------------
This is related to the above problem. But in programming you use a variety
of characters that you don't always use typing other kinds of documents.
Learn the locations of the following by heart:

    - Number sign (for commenting): #
    - Dollar sign (for variables): $
    - Underscore (for variable naming): _
    - Parentheses: ()
    - Brackets: []
    - Curly brackets: {}
    - Tilde (i.e. the squiggle; for going $HOME): ~
    - Math symbols ("+", "-", "*", "/", "=")

OK so after I made this list, I realized it's basically everything on the
keyboard isn't a letter or number. But you need to learn them anyway.

Learn hot keys for window management
------------------------------------
**The mouse is your enemy.** Yes, it revolutionized the computerâ€“human
interaction. But the more time you spend using your mouse, the less time
you spend with your hands on the keyboard and doing useful things.

But I *need* my mouse, you say. I say: no, you don't. You can do everything
with your keyboard. There are several hot keys that you should learn that
will maximize your productivity on the computer by minimizing your use of
the mouse.

    - <Alt>-Tab : You can flip through windows quickly and effortlessly
      without ever touching your mouse.

Learn to use a terminal text editor
-----------------------------------
`gedit` is great for newbies. But if you want to bring your script-fu to
the next level, you need to learn to use a text editor.

There are two types of nerds in this world: those that use `vim`, and
those that use `emacs`. I'm a `vim`-user. I can't even log out of `emacs`.

Learning an editor like `vim` increases productivity substantially,
because it allows you to:

    - run the editor within an existing terminal, without opening a new
      window
    - work on multiple documents simultaneously
    - syntax highlight your code
    - lots of other things

You can run `vim` from the terminal prompt::

    $ vim filename.txt

To quit a vim instance, you need to:

    1. enter `command mode` with the colon key
    2. write the file
    3. quit the program

This can be accomplished in one go by typing::

    :wq

In your copious spare time, and after you have mastered the basics of
shell, Python and R programming, you should take a tutorial on using a
text editor. Check out the Tutorial at http://www.openvim.com/ first.
