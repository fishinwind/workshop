Programming Tips & Tricks
=========================

Overview
--------
Several things influence how effectively you learn to program, and how
well you program once you have mastered the basic ideas. Most of these
things have to do with your efficiency in actaully *using* a computer, and
not programming *per se*.

For example, the longer you spend searching for a particular key to type,
or surfing around with your mouse, the less time you spend writing,
running and debugging programs. Here are several pointers to help you
become more efficient at using computers, independent of actually learning
programming languages.

Learn to type
-------------
Hunting and pecking is inefficient, and prevents you from spending your
valuable time efficiently. If you're looking at your keyboard, you're
*not* looking at the screen, reading and debugging code. Once you have
typing basics down, you should be typing 40-50 words per minute, without
ever looking at the keyboard.

There are several good, modern tools [#]_ to help you master touch-typing.

Learn to type funny characters
------------------------------
This is related to the above problem. But in programming you use a variety
of characters that you don't always use typing other kinds of documents.
Learn the locations of the following by heart:

    - Number sign (for commenting): #
    - Dollar sign (for variables): $
    - Underscore (for variable naming): _
    - Parentheses: ()
    - Brackets: []
    - Curly brackets: {}
    - Tilde (i.e. the squiggle; for going $HOME): ~
    - Math symbols ("+", "-", "*", "/", "=")

OK, so after I made this list, I realized it's basically everything on the
keyboard isn't a letter or number. But you need to learn them anyway.

Learn hot keys for window management
------------------------------------
**The mouse is your enemy.** Yes, it revolutionized the computerâ€“human
interaction. But the more time you spend using your mouse, the less time
you spend with your hands on the keyboard and doing useful things.

But I *need* my mouse, you say. I say: no, you don't. You can do everything
with your keyboard. There are several hot keys [#]_ that you should learn that
will maximize your productivity on the computer by minimizing your use of
the mouse.

    - **<Alt>-Tab** : Flip through windows quickly and effortlessly
      without ever touching your mouse.

.. tip::

    Make windows launch automatically during login. For example, you could
    automatically launch four terminal windows and a browser window,
    without having to click.

Learn to use a terminal text editor
-----------------------------------
`gedit` is great for newbies. But if you want to bring your script-fu to
the next level, you need to learn to use a text editor.

There are two types of nerds in this world: 

    1. `vim` users
    2. `emacs` users
    
I'm a `vim`-user. I can't even log out of an `emacs` session.

Learning a text editor like `vim` increases productivity substantially,
because it allows you to:

    - run the editor within an existing terminal, without opening a new
      window
    - work on multiple documents simultaneously
    - syntax highlight your code
    - manipulate blocks of text quickly and efficiently

You can run `vim` from the terminal prompt::

    $ vim filename.txt

To quit a vim session, you need to:

    1. enter `command mode` with the colon key
    2. write the file
    3. quit the program

This can be accomplished by typing::

    :wq <enter>

In your copious spare time, and after you have mastered the basics of
shell, Python and R programming, you should take a tutorial on using a
text editor. Check out this Tutorial [#]_ first.
