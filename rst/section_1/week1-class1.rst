VM
--

The VM will let you run linux on your laptop.

We can't teach you bioinformatics on windows.

Directories
-----------

You will learn about directories in the next class, but note that the
content for this class is available in:

    /opt/bio-workshop/

When you write answers to your homeworks, they should be runnable from
a directory like:

   /opt/bio-workshop/homeworks/section_1/week1/

We will remind you of this.
