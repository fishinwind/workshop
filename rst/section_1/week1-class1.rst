Week 1 Class 1 - VM and Linux Intro
===================================

Goals
-----
0. Class overview
1. get VM installed.
2. continue learning to navigate within the terminal
3. understand the linux philosophy (small tools that do one thing well)
4. understand how to apply some common linux utilities to files
5. understand how to chain these operations


Class Overview
--------------
Each class is 1.5 hours. We intend to spend the first 30 min going
through the exercises. During the remaining hour, we expect you to work
through the exercises, asking for help when you get stuck. 

We will record the first 30 minutes using Panopto Screen Capture, and
these recordings will be available in Canvas. We have found that simply
watching someone work in a terminal (move around, open up text editors,
write and execute simple programs) can be a very effective way to get
started with programming. Hopefully these movies will serve the same
purpose.

Each week, we will have 1 take home quiz, due the following Tuesday at 5
PM. 

VM
--
The VM will let you run linux on your laptop, or the laptops available at
the Teaching Lab. The VM has many of the tools you will need for analysis
pre-installed. Feel free to install other tools that you think will be
useful.

Directories
-----------
You will learn about directories in the next class, but note that the
content for this class is available in:

    /opt/bio-workshop/

When you write answers to your homeworks, they should be runnable from
a directory like:

   /opt/bio-workshop/homeworks/section_1/week1/

We will remind you of this.

Reading
-------
There are a few papers that we suggest you read. 

Computational biology projects inevitably accrue a lot of files, and 
This paper is a great way to get started on organizing all of this
information:

1. Organization for computational biology projects
