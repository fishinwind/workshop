Class Overview

Each class is 1.5 hours. We intend to spend the first 30 min going
throught the exercises.

VM

The VM will let you run linux on your laptop.

We can't teach you bioinformatics on windows.

Directories
-----------

You will learn about directories in the next class, but note that the
content for this class is available in:

    /opt/bio-workshop/

When you write answers to your homeworks, they should be runnable from
a directory like:

   /opt/bio-workshop/homeworks/section_1/week1/

We will remind you of this.
