- Open lamina.bed and print the start position of each entry

- Print the total coverage of entries in lamina.bed

- Convert lamina.bed into a list inside python. Then, print each entry in the list. 

- Find the average value of entries in lamina.bed (watch out for int/float issues)

- Find the median value of entries in lamina.bed

- Use a python dict object to count the number of entries on each chromosome in
lamina.bed. 

- Do the same thing as the previous exercise, but using a Counter object. Then,
use the built-in Counter methods to find out which chromosomes have the largest
and smallest number of entries. 

- Create a python script that takes a chromosome number, and finds all entries
in lamina.bed that are on that chromosome. 

- Modify the previous script to use argparse, so that it will find entries on
every chromosome by default unless given an argument to look on a particular
chromosome. 

- Use regular expressions and states.tab to find all states whose names include
'c' and 'o' in that order, with or without other letters in between.
