Class Overview
==============
Each class is 2 hours. We intend to spend the first 60 min going
through exercises that demonstrate how specific tools are useful in
bioinformatics. During the remaining hour, we expect you to work through
exercises, asking for help when you get stuck. 

We will record the classes using Panopto Screen Capture, and these
recordings will be available in Canvas. We have found that simply watching
someone work in a terminal (move around, open up text editors, write and
execute simple programs) can be a very effective way to get started with
programming. 

Each week, we will have 1 take home quiz, due the following Tuesday at 5
PM. 

Computers
=========
You will need to bring a laptop to each class. 

Mac laptops
-----------
1. Install Homebrew

PC laptops
----------
*If* you're running a fully updated 64 bit install of Windows 10, the instructions below show how to activate Developer Mode & install the Bash shell:

        http://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-get-linux-bash-windows-10-3-steps
If not, you will need to:
-----------
1. Install VirtualBox.
2. Install a Linux distribution as a virtual machine (e.g., Ubuntu).

Software
========
1. RStudio


Problem Sets
============
We will distribute all problem sets through github. The class has a Github
organization here: 

To gain access to the problem sets, You need to:

1. Sign up for an account on github.com
2. Send me your login name.

Once you are associated with the class github page, you should be able to
see your first problem set, due on |ps1-date|.

Starting a new problem set
--------------------------
1. Fork the problem set to your github account.
2. Make changes to the problem set and commit them. Continue making
changes and committing until you have a final product.
3. To submit your homework, submit a pull request to the main repository.

Discussions can be filed as `Issues` on the Github page for each problem
set.

Guidelines
----------

Shell and Python Programming
============================
It is important that you learn a few new computer languages. Others have
developed very good guides to teach you these languages, and we are going
to use those in the class. We expect you to begin taking these classes
immediately.

You will spend a lot of time going through these online classes, both in
scheduled class time, and outside of class time. Instead of focusing on
teaching you these languages, we will focus on helping you get through all
of the frustating problems that come up when you're learning the languages.

We will spend the first ~2 weeks learning shell [#]_ and all the things
you have access to within the shell.

        http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/

After learning the shell, we will begin learning R and several packages
within R.

Finally, we will begin learning Python [#]_. The Python language allows
you to do more sophisticated things that would be possible in shell or R, but
would be considerably more clunky.

First Quiz : Reading
====================
Computational biology projects inevitably accrue a lot of files.  This
paper describes a scheme for organizing files that provides some
suggestions on how to organize.  We suggest that you use this scheme (or a
similar one) for all of your projects in and out of the class.
