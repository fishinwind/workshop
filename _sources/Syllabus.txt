Course Description
==================

**The Genome Analysis Workshop is a hands-on tutorial of skills needed to
process large genomics data sets and visualize their results. The class
is taught from the standpoint of biologist with practical goals
(e.g. to interpret the results of a sequencing-based experiment and gain
biologically meaningful insight).**

We focus on working in the Linux environment, with emphasis on Linux
command-line tools, Python programming and the R statistical computing
environment. We use publicly available next-generation DNA sequencing data
from the ENCODE project to illustrate standard approaches for manipulating
sequencing data, aligning sequences to a reference genome, generating
coverage plots and displaying them in the UCSC Genome Browser. We will
cover specific analyses used in ENCODE project including ChIP-seq, DNase I
footprinting, mRNA-seq and genome sequencing to identify single nucleotide
and structural variants.

Course Credits
--------------

This is a 3 credit course.

Course Objectives
-----------------

+ Learn to manipulate large sequencing data sets with Linux command line
  tools and Python programming.

+ Learn to manipulate and visualize data with the R statistical
  computing environment.

+ Learn workflows for ENCODE experiments including ChIP-seq, mRNA-seq and
  variant detection.

Canvas 
======

The course has a Canvas page [#]_ where announcements are made and
problem sets are uploaded. You need to login to see Announcements and
Problem Sets.

Assessment
==========

Progress of individual students will be assessed during the daily exercise
session, weekly problem sets, as well as a final project.

Grading Criteria
----------------

+ 50% participation
+ 40% problem sets (10 sets, 4% each)
+ 10% final project

.. _syllabus-specific-dates:

.. problem sets staring really piling up after ps3 in spring 2015. Maybe
.. have a break after every 3.
