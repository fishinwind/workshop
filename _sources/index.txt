~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **New**: you will need your own laptop for the class. And IDEALLY it is
  a Mac or Linux machine. You can run Linux under VirtualBox on Windows.

* **Class size is limited to 20. We anticipate being full, so register
  early.**

* `Tuition waivers

  are available for Postdocs and PRAs. You also need to fill out a
  `non-degree application

Course Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The Genome Analysis Workshop is a hands-on tutorial of skills needed to
process large genomics data sets and visualize their results. The class is
taught from the standpoint of a biologist with practical goals (e.g., to
interpret the results of a sequencing-based experiment and gain
biologically meaningful insight).**

We focus on working in the Linux environment, with emphasis on
command-line tools, Python programming and the R statistical computing
environment. We use publicly available next-generation DNA sequencing data
from the ENCODE project to illustrate standard approaches for manipulating
sequencing data, aligning sequences to a reference genome, generating
coverage plots and displaying them in the UCSC Genome Browser. We will
cover specific analyses used in ENCODE project including ChIP-seq, DNase I
footprinting, mRNA-seq and genome sequencing to identify single nucleotide
variants.
