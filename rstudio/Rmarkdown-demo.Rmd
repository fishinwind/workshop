# Summary
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Common libraries
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
```

## Loading data
```{r}
# assumes workshop repo is in $HOME/devel
setwd("~/devel/workshop/content/misc/data")

# load bed data
bed.df <- read.delim('lamina.bed', header=TRUE)
# fixup chrom name
names(bed.df)[1] <- 'chrom'

# load expr data
expr.df <- read.delim('expr-geno-covs.txt', header=TRUE)

# load peaks data
peaks.df <- read.delim('peaks.chr22.bed.gz', 
                       col.names = c('chrom','start','end','name'))
```

## Summarizing data
First, we can dynamically generate some simple statistics. For example, there are `r length(unique(bed.df$chrom))` chromosomes in the BED file we loaded.

You can also generate view of the data with:

```{r}
summary(bed.df)

table(expr.df$condition)

# part of the `knitr` package
kable(head(expr.df))
```

## Plots

Let's have a look at the distribution of CpG sizes on each chromosome in the `lamina.bed` file:

```{r, message=FALSE}
bed.df %>%
  mutate(cpg.size = end - start) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log10(cpg.size), y = ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = 'grey50') +
  facet_wrap(~chrom, scales = 'free_y')
```

Can also use the new ggvis for this, but doesn't support faceting yet. Also Rmarkdown doesn't support emoji :(((. `ggvis` also breaks PDF output (HTML only).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggvis)
bed.df %>%
  mutate(cpg.size = end - start) %>%
  ggvis(~factor(chrom), ~log10(cpg.size)) %>% 
  layer_boxplots() %>%
  add_axis("x", title='', properties = axis_props(labels = list(angle = -90)))
```

## Data mainuplation

```{r}
# first few enntries of each transcription factor
peaks.df %>% group_by(name) %>% slice(1:2)
```

## Fancier manipluation

Aggregation functions in dplyr return 1 value for each of n inputs, e.g. the mean of peak widths for each factor

Windowing functions return n values for n inputs and enable more expressive analysis.

<http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html>

For each factor, find its largest peaks using `min_rank()`:

```{r}
peaks.df %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(peak.width = end - start) %>%
  filter(min_rank(desc(peak.width)) == 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(peak.width)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable()
```

For each factor, find the peaks that make up the top 10% of their bases covered:

```{r}
peaks.df %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(peak.width = end - start) %>%
  filter(cume_dist(peak.width) < 0.1) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable()
```

Find TFs that tend to have neighboring peaks using `lead()` or `lag()`. The `order_by` argument specifies the variable to order the rows by (default is `row_number`:

```{r}
peaks.df %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  filter(name == lead(name, order_by = start)) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  kable()
``` 

Cumulative density of peak widths for each factor.

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 10}
peaks.df %>%
  arrange(name, start) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(peak.width = end - start) %>%
  ggplot(aes(log10(peak.width))) + stat_ecdf() + facet_wrap(~name)
```

### Questions

- How would you modify the above code chunks to figure out what proportion of peaks these represent?
