# Summary
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Common libraries
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
```

## Loading data
```{r}
# assumes workshop repo is in $HOME/devel
setwd("~/devel/workshop/content/misc/data")

# load bed data
bed.df <- read.delim('lamina.bed', header=TRUE)
# fixup chrom name
names(bed.df)[1] <- 'chrom'

# load expr data
expr.df <- read.delim('expr-geno-covs.txt', header=TRUE)
```

## Summarizing data
First, we can dynamically generate some simple statistics. For example, there are `r length(unique(bed.df$chrom))` chromosomes in the BED file we loaded.

You can also generate view of the data with:

```{r}
summary(bed.df)

table(expr.df$condition)

# part of the `knitr` package
kable(head(expr.df))
```

## Plots

Let's have a look at the distribution of CpG sizes on each chromosome in the `lamina.bed` file:

```{r, message=FALSE}
bed.df %>%
  mutate(cpg.size = end - start) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log10(cpg.size), y = ..density..)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2, fill = 'grey50') +
  facet_wrap(~chrom)
```

Can also use the new ggvis for this, but doesn't support faceting yet. Also Rmarkdown doesn't support emoji :(((.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggvis)
bed.df %>%
  mutate(cpg.size = end - start) %>%
  ggvis(~factor(chrom), ~log10(cpg.size)) %>% 
  layer_boxplots() %>%
  add_axis("x", title='', properties = axis_props(labels = list(angle = -90)))
```
